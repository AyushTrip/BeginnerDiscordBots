# Discord Bots
Here are some beginner discord bots I made with the Discord Py module. Super basic functionalities. These simply take user input and can be added to servers to preform basic functions.


To ensure that the bot can run if you try to do it locally. You will need to visit the 'https://discord.com/developers/applications' website to create a new bot and get the run token. From there, you can use a basic website such as replit.com and paste in the token ID to make it run locally. 

If you aren't using the services provided from replit or some other online interpreter, there are a few modules you'll need to run the program.

### For Windows Users
- Go into the command prompt and type
   - ```pip install discord```
   - ```pip install requests```
   - ```pip install json```
   - ```pip install asyncio```
